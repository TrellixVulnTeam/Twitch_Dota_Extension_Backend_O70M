# Twitch-Extension-Backend
## About Me
Work in progress. This is the backend for the Twitch Dota Extension I'm working on. It includes the Dota 2 GSI from https://github.com/xzion/dota2-gsi.

### Brief Description
This was put together with "prototyping" in mind. A lot more cleanup and optimisation can be done, but the intiial goal is to test if the idea is feasible to begin with smaller Dota 2 streamers.
